  <h3>Learn about AI and its many uses with the help of Monitor</h3>
  <article class="">


    <p>We at Monitor want the world to know about AI. This subject is often seen as something like a super computer that makes killer robot or such. But we want to change that and make people understand how AI is already used in your daily lives to make it easier for you. There is probably some AI you know about like Google and Siri who you can ask things and it will give you a response. This kind of AI is more made to be human and interactive. You might think that its this that makes an AI an AI and this is close. If you look up the word AI you will find that it is more then a natural intelligence like those displayed by humans and animals. Artificial intelligence (AI) is what you would say a intelligence which lacks of the consciousness and the emotions that humans and animals have.

  <p>As an example for a Strong AI we will refer to Google AI that organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Jeff Dean who is the leader of the Google AI project says
<br><br>
“AI is making it easier for people to do things every day, whether it’s searching for photos of loved ones, breaking down language barriers in Google Translate, typing emails on the go, or getting things done with the Google Assistant. AI also provides new ways of looking at existing problems, from rethinking healthcare to advancing scientific discovery.”

<h2>How AI Monitoring Works</h2>
<p>AI monitors you on a daily basis as it records every search you do on the we or anything else related to your internet from what music you listen to, to the train you take to work. AI help the traffic a lot as it can monitor how many people move trough the week and can make the traffic better for the people moving through. Thanks to this function of an AI a lot of accidents have been avoided and traffic is a lot safer. Remember that the information that AI’s such as Google AI is not allowed to leak information of you, so no need to worry that you spend to much time watching videos of cats. We do advice that you refrain from putting up to personal information on the internet as many people can find you thanks to how easy it is to find information on the internet now adays.

If you do feel like you have the need to make your privacy more private check the privacy settings you have <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/114836?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en-GB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="web2link">here.</a>

<h3>AI Surveillance</h3>
<article>

  <p>AI surveillance is what Monitor is all about we want you to know just how monitored you are, but do you know just how much?
<br> <br>
To tell you just how monitored you are we took help from Steve Nouri who is the Head of Data Science and AI at Australian Computer Society. According to Steve there is millions of cameras operating 24/7 all over the globe but noone is operating them as the AI does all the work for the man. Humans would not be able to work 24/7 but AI however can process every frame and present real-time analysis to save millions of lives. These AI surveillance technologies can map, track and control people to meet various policy aims and even some legitimate, some violating human rights and some which fall into a gray area.

  <p>AI is the future for many kinds of work. To quote Steve :
<br>
“The reason AI is making a vast impact is because of its self-learning capabilities.
 Initially, the computer learned to reason about objects of interest in the scene.
 Now, it detects the objects in the real world, matches the results with the correct annotations (provided by humans) and tries to improve further.
 This way, it is constantly learning and improving.
 Error is minimized with every iteration and moves closer to — or even better than — human error.”
